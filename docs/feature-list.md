# maintainerd-auth-identity — Feature List

A complete inventory of capabilities exposed by the **Maintainerd Auth Identity** app, mapped against the corresponding capabilities of the [`maintainerd-auth`](https://github.com/maintainerd/auth) backend.

This file is the frontend counterpart to [`maintainerd-auth/docs/feature-list.md`](https://github.com/maintainerd/auth/blob/main/docs/feature-list.md). The backend file is the source of truth for what the platform *can* do; this file tracks what the console actually *exposes*.

Legend:

- `[x]` Implemented in the console (page + service + hook)
- `[~]` Partially implemented (notes inline — e.g. route exists but renders a placeholder, or only a subset of the API is wired up)
- `[ ]` Missing / not yet implemented in the console
- 🔴 Critical — required for the console to be useful in production
- 🟡 High priority
- 🟢 Medium / nice-to-have
- ⚪ Low / optional

> **Scope note.** This console targets the **internal management port** (`:8080`) only. End-user OAuth2 flows (login widget, consent screen, RP-initiated logout, hosted MFA challenge) belong in a separate public-facing app and are explicitly **out of scope** here. Items in the backend feature list that only make sense as end-user UI are omitted; items that an admin needs to **configure or audit** are included.

## Quick-Start Recommendation

If you address these items first, the console becomes substantially more useful and substantially safer:

1. **Show secrets only once** for OAuth clients and API keys, then mask them (§6, §7).
2. **Generic CRUD factory** to collapse the ~330-line per-resource service files into one factory (§26).
3. **Tests** — Vitest unit coverage for hooks + Playwright happy-path E2E (§26).
4. **Real pages for `events` / `webhooks` / `branding` root** instead of the dashboard placeholder (§22, §19, §26).
5. **Per-user sessions list with revoke** (§13).
6. **Consent-grant management** for OAuth clients (§6).
7. **JWKS viewer + key rotation** (§18).
8. **Tenant-scoped Query cache keys** (§26).

Everything else is incremental enhancement on top of those foundations.
